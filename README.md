# online_store

It was my first web project, ts an e-commerce website coded in 48hours using PHP HTML CSS. 

It sells cheese and slippers and sometimes cheese slippers. 

### How to run it :

```
git clone https://github.com/barthelemyleveque/online_store.git 
cd online_store
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000. 

You can create an account, add products to your baskets and then order.

An admin page is available to add, modify or delete products and see the orders history.
